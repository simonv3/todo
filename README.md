### What

Tell me what to do. I will think about doing it, and respond to you.

### Why

Because I want people to have a way to tell me what they think I can do best.

### Where

In the [issues](/issues).

### Who

Me.

### How

Open an issue. I'll look at it.

### When

Whenever I get to it. Probably soon, I live on GitHub.

### Whither

Now you're just being ridiculous.

### Wherefore

...

### Other questions

If you want to ask me stuff, go to my [ama](https://github.com/RichardLitt/ama) and ask me there.
